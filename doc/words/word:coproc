name:                coproc
stack:               ( xt -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            experimental

decription:          launches the word with execution token xt as coproc, that is, running
                     it as sub process, with I/O detached, wasn't it for that this word
                     "coproc" then redirects input and output to the sub process.
                     This is a remainder of my attempts to achieve real warm start capability
                     in error, abort or break (Ctrl-C) case.
                     While coproc wasn't the solution, I kept it nevertheless in case it
                     may be useful for another purpose.
                     Also see "wait" for the word launching the coproc to synchronise with it
                     finishing.
