name:                resolve
stack:               ( -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
category:            compiler

decription:          performs a resolve run if any unresolved references exist,
                     attempting to resolve those from postlib by conditional
                     compilation. resolve may repeat the attempt when new forward
                     references are created as result of resolving others. When
                     no more unresolved references exist, or no more forward
                     references are resolved and no new forward references are
                     introduced, resolve considers its work as done and returns.

contexts:            interpreting, compiling
notes:               resolve may be executed whenever it seem appropriate. You may
                     execute it interactively, after declaring a word as needed
                     (see: need), but it will also be called by the compiler in some
                     situations: after setting a boot vector, or before passing
                     control to a just compiled program from command line. In latter
                     case will yoda refuse execution if any unresolved references
                     remain.
                     see also "instantresolve" for implicit execution of resolve in
                     interactive mode.
