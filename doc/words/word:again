name:                again
stack:               ( -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            compileonly
category:            flow control

decription:          conclude a begin ... again structure, by compiling code
                     which unconditionally jumps back to begin.

standard:            no
deviation:           stack during compilation:  ( C: dest -- )
                     yoda has no concept of branch destinations and can't
                     therefore stack them. As consequence will again not
                     remove those.
