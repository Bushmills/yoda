decription:          take a string from string stack during compilation,
                     compile it into currently build definition such
                     that the string will be pushed to string stack when
                     the definition executes.

example:             : foo  [ thisfile$ ] literal$ type$ ;
                     \ prints the name of the file in which foo was defined
