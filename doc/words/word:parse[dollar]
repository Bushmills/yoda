string stack:        ( -- $1 )
contexts:            stateless
category:
input stream:        a string, delimited by c

decription:          parses input for a character with ASCII c. Removes the portion
                     up to and including that character from input, and places it as
                     top item on string stack, delimiter c excluded.
                     The whole line will be removed (i.e. emptied) and pushed to
                     string stack if a character with ASCII c can't be found.
