category:            compilation, dictionary
input stream:        space delimited word

decription:          begin compilation of a high level "colon" definition.
                     A space delimited word is taken from input stream and
                     used as name for the new definition. After that follow
                     code, which will be compiled and associated with the
                     name of the definition. Compilation ends at semicolon (;)

example:             : foo hello ;
notes:               the stacked values x1 and x2 are not meant to be exposed
                     to user. these are stacked for sanity checking the definition,
                     and consumed by semicolon.
