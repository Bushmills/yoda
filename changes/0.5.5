made instantresolve independent from forwardrefs.
instantly resolving utilises satisfy instead of need now, and has been turned on by default.
consequence is that unknown words, entered while interpreting, will be loaded from library,
compiled, then executed, behaving as they had been in the dictionary all along.
unknown words during compilation fall now under jurisdiction of need/resolve while dealing with
interpret time unknowns is delegated to satisfy (though resolve utilises satisfy too). Consider
satisfy as an immediate response to requesting unknown words, while need produces a delayed response
(delayed until execution of resolve, or until word was defined)
