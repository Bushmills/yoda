TOPIC: configuration

Adjusting yoda to your personal preferences can largely be done in
the file yoda.conf.  That files resides in the same directory where
yoda is found, and is included during launch.
For all settings, reasonable or at least hopefully functioning defaults
have been set. Change those as needed. 0 turns them off, other values
enable them, unless text is expected as paramter.

default='boot quit'                   # command line used  when yoda was executed without command line
trace=0                               # 1: become more chatty during execution
log=0                                 # 1: writes execution of some actions to a log file
codedump=0
break=2                               # what do to after Ctrl-C: 0:return 1:exit 2:execute cold
clean=1                               # 1: clean stacks on error
callstack=0                           # 0: disable call stack print on error. n: show n items

editor="vi"                           # editors run in console, not backgrounded
xeditor="featherpad"                  # xeditors open window and are backgrounded

doc="$mydir/doc"                      # mydir is where yoda has determined to reside itself. set doc root
topicdoc="$doc/topics"                # where are topics stored
worddoc_prefix="word"                 # each word doc file uses this string as base name
worddoc="$doc/words/$worddoc_prefix"  # set directory and word doc prefix

libdirs+="..."                        # add another directory to list where yoda looks for library files
libdirs+=("$PWD")                     # example: add current directory
libdirs+=("$mydir")                   # example: add directory where yoda resides
libdirs+=("/usr/local/lib/yoda")      # example: add literal directory path

bits=n                                # set cell width. 16..63 are reasonable.
                                      # be aware that 16 is a tad small for epoch or
                                      # higher resolution time measurements.
header_code="function"                # leading part of function names
nextname="1000"                       # functions are numbered, starting with this number.
