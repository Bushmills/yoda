stack:               ( -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            defining
input stream:        space delimited string

decription:          reads a word name from input and creates a word which acts
                     as execution vector: initially bound to no operation, it will
                     have no effect (apart from wasting a few CPU cycles). By means
                     of the word "is" can semantics of any word be assigned to the
                     deferred word. Fromon that moment it behaves like an alias, but
                     can be reassigned semantics of any other word anytime.

example:             defer foo     ' space is foo
notes:               see also: is
                     it is probably a bad idea to assign its own run time semantics to it.

standard:            yes
