description:         jump to end of loop conditinally. If flag is not false, loop parameters
                     will be cleaned up, and execution continues after end of
                     loop. If flag is false, execution continues with the word following
                     ?leave.

notes:               ?leave can be used with all these loop constructs:
                     do ... loop
                     ?do ... loop
                     do ... +loop
                     ?do ... +loop
                     for ... next
                     times

                     see leave for an unconditional version of ?leave

standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
