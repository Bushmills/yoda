description:         part of creating new wordlists, responsable for creating the
                     bash data structures holding wordlist data, and adding wordlist
                     to list of existing wordlists.
                     Does not associate wordlist with name of wordlist, but expects
                     that to be done already (see: newwordlist$), with wid referencing
                     wordlist name. This allows creation of nameless wordlists, which are
                     only referenced by wid, but not by name.

standard:            no
