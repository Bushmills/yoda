stack:               ( n1 n2 -- n3 n4 )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            arithmetic

decription:          divides the n1 by n2, returns remainder as n3, quotient as n4

standard:            I think so
                     must check whether signs matches those of standard
