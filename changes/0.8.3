experimentally treating instantresolve like forwardrefs in definitions, if
   they are resolvable from library.
   consequence is that words which can be resolved from library need neither
   forwardrefs on, nor, alternatively, a prior "need word". Instead those
   words will silently be loaded and resolved.  instantresolve must still be on.
   ("shortcuts" ü+i, -i for turning on and off instant resolves, and +f, -f for
   forward refs exist and can be resolved from library).
