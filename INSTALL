For starting, you need at least these two files:
yoda
primitives.sh

While yoda will be able to run with just these two
files, you still may want to grab the rest, especially
yoda.conf, quit, and the subdirectories doc and lib.

Further instructions assume presence of files prelib 
and postlib in the lib directory:

For an initial run, change to the directory which contains
the files yoda, primitives.sh and quit, and run there:
bash yoda quit

This requires that you have bash installed on your system.

Should you be greeted with a "Yoda shell" message, your
setup appears to be fine. Verify by tapping the "Enter"
key: an " ok" message should be produced.

Next steps could be to:
1. create symlinks to yoda and quit in a directory which
is in your PATH.  /usr/local/bin may be a good candidate:

2. Make sure your bash can be found where the hashbangs in
quit and yoda expect it, as /bin/bash.  Change hashbangs or
location, if it can't

2. edit and customise, if appropriate, the file yoda.conf.
All settings should have been set to reasonable defaults,
but your preferences may differ.
