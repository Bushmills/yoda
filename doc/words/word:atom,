description:         fetches top string stack element $1, interprets it as
                     label for atomic code, and compiles associated atomic
                     code into the word under construction.

example:             : dup [ "dup" ] atom,  ;
notes:               "atomic code" is a remnant of the compiler yoda was
                     spawned off. As yoda doesn't contain the mechanisms
                     atomic code is meant for, it can be considered a relict,
                     and may eventually disappear completely.

standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
