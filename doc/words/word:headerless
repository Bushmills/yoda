name:                headerless
stack:               ( -- xt )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            dictionary

decription:          renders the last word headerless and produces its execution
                     token xt. For defing the word, prior to use of "headerless",
                     a name is still needed. That name can of course be a throwaway
                     dummy name.
                     As headerless operates on words in general, not just on colon
                     words, any newly defined dictionary word can be rendered
                     headerless.

example:             : foo ... ;  headerless execute
notes:               You may want to keep execution token, or access to the word
                     will be lost.
