description:         completes a pictured number conversion sequence, by
                     finalising the buffered converted number, outputting
                     it, and cleaning up stacks.
                     meant to be used in conjunction with <#

example:             <# # # #>type
notes:               functional equivalent to "#> type", but more efficient.
