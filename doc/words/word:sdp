stack:               ( -- a )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            strings

decription:          a variable whose contents are incremented for each created
                     $constant or $variable. $arrays also allocate their defined
                     number of items by bumping sdb accordingly. Its value is used
                     as index into a string array where $constant, $variables or
                     $array instances store or keep their contents.

notes:               probably not overly useful for programs, but needed to expose
                     this variable, as definitions of $constant, $variable and $array
                     have to be able to access it.
                     name stands for "dp of strings"

                     sdp is likely to be replaced against here$ and allot$
