decription:          scans all files in first defined library directory and its
                     subdirectories for lines beginning with "provides:". reads
                     the least of word names following on that line, and creates or
                     updates a database file with word name to file path and name
                     relationship.
                     The compiler consults this file to locate source of forward
                     resolvable words for inclusion.

notes:               should be executed to build or refresh if one of these
                     conditions apply:
                      -  fresh yoda installation
                      -  library files moved, added, removed, renamed
                      -  words in library files added, removed, renamed or moved between
                         library files
                      -  library base directory changed (first entry in ${libdirs[]} array,
                         configuration item)
                      generation of new file may take a few seconds.

                     recently yoda has been changed to execute dependencies during
                     launch if no dependencies file exists. Therefore, often you'd
                     not need to execute `dependencies` yourself, as you can, prior
                     to starting yoda, simply delete an existing dependency file.
