description:         places double quotes around top of string stack

notes:               like a parameterless bracket$, provided because placing
                     literal strings containing double quotes on string stack
                     isn't yet comfortably done.
                     Considering to add a single quote pattern, but that'd
                     collide with the already existing patterns for returning
                     single char ASCII values.

standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
