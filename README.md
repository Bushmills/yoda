# yoda

yoda is an acronym of Yet Onather Delirious Application, though some rather call it "Yoda: Overdose of Duct-tape Abstractions" or even "Yoda: Overengineered Digital Anachronism".

The name does naturally not refer to any greenish midget with pointy ears, albeit it had
been said that reading yoda source aloud sounds like the very same midget
talking.

yoda implements a compiler which converts a close resemblance of Forth
source code to bash functions, an interpreter which runs them, and a base
vocabulary of useful functions, strongly orientated towards what a common
Forth interpreter offers.  It can be used to augment bash, can serve as
shell, or as Forthish coding environment.

yoda facilitates exploring it, by providing words for examining misc
aspects, described on the [Explore wiki page](https://github.com/Bushmills/yoda/wiki/Explore).

By now is yoda more standards compliant than I originally believed it to be feasable. Only
few differences remain. Consequently has the pool of code intending to demonstrate the
differences been ground down. Only few source code examples remain in
[Examples wiki page](https://github.com/Bushmills/yoda/wiki/Examples). By the same token
has the extent of the file describing the deviations been reduced too:
[Differences wiki page](https://github.com/Bushmills/yoda/wiki/Differences).

My musings, ideas, plans and thoughts of possible changes can be found at
[Considerations wiki
page](https://github.com/Bushmills/yoda/wiki/Considerations), and the rest possibly
among the [remaining wiki pages](https://github.com/Bushmills/yoda/wiki/Home).

yoda has been coded as bash script with only a small count of [external dependencies](https://github.com/Bushmills/yoda/wiki/Dependencies)
