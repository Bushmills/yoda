description:         a variable, containing the radix ("number base") applied when
                     converting integers to strings or vice versa. Any value from
                     2 to 36 is considered a valid radix.
                     words decimal, hex and binary have been defined for setting
                     contents of base to commonly used values.

notes:               for number input, a leading base indicator can be used without the
                     need to change base:  $ for hex,  # for decimal and % for binary.
                     $ff, #255 and %11111111 will be evaluated as (identical) numbers
                     of their respective radix, regardless of the value base has been
                     set to.
