category:            file, compiling

decription:          produce the file handle of the file from which source is currently
                     read and compiled from.

standard:            collision
deviation:           yoda's source is closer to standard's SOURCE-ID ( -- 0 | -1 | fileid )
                     Renaming is considered.
