name:                boot
stack:               ( -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            system
input stream:        space delimited string

decription:          reads a space delimited string from input stream
                     and writes the excution token of the word with that
                     name to cold start vector. (Well, almost - actually the
                     function name is written, but function names and execution
                     tokens bear a one-to-one relationship).
                     Should the word not exist, it will be marked as forward reference,
                     in the expectation that it will be available later.

example:             boot quit

standard:            no
                     standard has no equivalent
