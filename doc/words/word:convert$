name:                convert$
stack:               ( -- x )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( $1 -- )
decription:          converts a string to a number
contexts:            interpreting, compiling

example:             "22" "05" join$ convert$ .
                     ( gives 2205 )

notes:               this function doesn't at this point respect value of number base,
                     but uses radix 10 for conversion. The string must therefore consist
                     of character 0...9 only, leading dash is permitted.
                     The string may also be a bash-computable expression.
