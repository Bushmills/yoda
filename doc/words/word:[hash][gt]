description:         meant to be used between at the end of a <# ... sequence, its operation
                     is part of converting an integer to a string of characters, stored in
                     memory (contrasting with "a string stored on string stack"). #> will
                     finalise conversion, then unpack string to a list of ASCII values, stored
                     in u consecutive memory locations at a

notes:               mostly added to maintain compatibility with standards and provide
                     the closing to a symmetric <# ... #>, the alternatives #>$ and
                     #>type are more efficient, due to not needing to unpack the string to
                     a list of ASCIIs in consecutive memory locations.
