name:                at
stack:               ( column row -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
category:            I/O

decription:          move cursor and output position to column, row. 0 0 is upper
                     left corner of screen.

contexts:            stateless

notes:               This sends a VT52/VT100/ANSI "Escape" sequence to output, therefore
                     cursor positioning will only be successful when terminal driver
                     intercepts and acts on those. Console and X terminals commonly do.
