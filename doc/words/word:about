category:            info
input stream:        word name

decription:          reads a word from input stream, which is appended to a dir/name
                     $worddoc, then used as path/file of a file whose contents are
                     displayed. Ideally "word" is the name of an existing yoda word,
                     which has already been described ("documemented"), in which case
                     will the displayed file contain some informative descriptions.

example:             about about
notes:               similar do doc, with the difference that file isn't opened in
                     an editor, but its contents merely displayed in the terminal
