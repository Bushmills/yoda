stack:               ( x -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            compileonly
category:            flow control, system

decription:          compiles an exit from a function, akin to exit,
                     but also returns a return value x, which can be
                     examined and responded to by the calling function.
                     This return has no meaning for and within yoda programs.
                     For functions to use it, yoda source must be modified
                     accordingly (or functions added which respond to
                     return values).

notes:               A leftover from passing errors through words back to
                     quit. Possibly obsolescent now, but kept for the time
                     being. You shouldn't need this.

standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
                     may be removed from yoda anytime
