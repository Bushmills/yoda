description:         moves the header of the most recently defined word into
                     the compile-only context vocabulary. The result is that
                     the word can only be found during compilation, but not
                     while interpreting.

example:             words "unless" and "times" have been defined with compile
                     time semantics different from interpret time semantics.

standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
