contexts:            stateless
category:            compilation
input stream:        whole input line

decription:          repeatedly reads a space delimited string from input line,
                     until input line has been consumed. Each string is taken as
                     name of a word, which is, if not already present, compiled
                     from its source file. Should no source file exist or be known,
                     is the word added to the list of (yet) unresolved words, for
                     compilation once its source becomes available.

example:             needs: hello red bg
