name:                key
stack:               ( -- c )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            I/O

decription:          Returns ASCII value of a pressed key as c on stack. In case
                     characters are buffered and waiting to be read, key takes
                     the next buffered key and removes it from buffer. When input
                     buffer is empty, key will wait until a key was pressed.

notes:               due to translation of key character to key ASCII value, using
                     key character as lookup index, not all keys deliver the
                     correct value. Some control keys will return 0 instead of their
                     value between 1 and 31. Among those are the Return key.

standard:            yes
