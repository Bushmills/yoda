version 0.6.1, 2022feb06,20:23
late headers: headers aren't created by defining words like create, variable, constant, : but instead
by semicolon. defining words merely place word name and analyser flag into code buffer, expecting
detokeniser to do header creation. Consequence ist that for words failing compilation no headers are
created at all, which eliminates a potentially needed hide/reveal scheme to exclude words from being
found as long compilation hasn't finished successfully. On the down side is source location now
recorded as the line containing the semicolon. There's a workaround possible, but hasn't been coded for
this version.
