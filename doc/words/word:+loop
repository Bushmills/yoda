decription:          concludes a do ... +loop flow control construct, which causes
                     the enclosed body to be executed (potentially) multiple times.
                     The parameters provided to do, values for initial loop index
                     and loop limit, are used by +loop such that n is added to loop
                     index, then compared against loop limit. If still within the range
                     of initial loop index and loop limit will a jump to code following
                     do be executed, otherwise will loop data be cleaned up, and code
                     proceeds with code following +loop.
