description:         convert single signed number to signed double

notes:               Even though yoda doesn't have support for double length arithmetics,
                     there may be a case where s>d may become useful, which is when
                     currently non-standard parameter passed to pictured number conversion
                     becomes standard compliant, requiring to pass a double length number
                     to <# # #s #>
