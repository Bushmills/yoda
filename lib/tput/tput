\ non compliant tput command builder:
\ according 200x does does>, when not used in conjunction with create,
\ yield an ambiguous condition.
\ tput employs the yoda specific response of using does> in conjunction
\ with a different defining word here:  constant.
\ result is merely slightly more efficient code for string retrieval.
