name:                immediate
stack:               ( -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            dictionary, compiling

decription:          move the header of the most recently created word
                     to the compile-only context vocabulary. As consequence
                     will the word execute when trying to compile it into
                     another word, and it can't be found when not compiling.

notes:               This replaces the traditional scheme of state-smart words.
                     The name choice is under consideration, as it is deemed
                     not a good one, overlapping with the traditional word
                     for making words state-smart.
