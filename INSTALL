For starting, you need at least these two files:
yoda
primitives.sh

But I recommend to also grab the rest, especially
yoda.conf, quit, and the subdirectories doc and lib

For an initial run, change to the directory which contains
the files yoda, primitives.sh and quit, and run there:
./yoda quit

This assumes that you have bash installed on your system,
which can be found in the directory /bin.

Should you be greeted with a "Yoda shell" message, your
setup appears to be fine. Verify by tapping the "Enter"
key: an " ok" message should be produced.

Next steps could be to:
1. create symlinks to yoda and quit in a directory which
is in your PATH.  /usr/local/bin may be a good candidate:

2. edit and customise, if it seems appropriate, the file
yoda.conf.  All settings ought to be set to reasonable
defaults, but your preferences may differ.
