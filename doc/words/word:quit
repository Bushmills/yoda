category:            interpreter

decription:          a loop, providing yoda an interactive mode for entering input
                     and executing it.

standard:            no
deviation:           "Accept a line from the input source into the input buffer,
                     set >IN to zero, and interpret."

                     Input processing doesn't use >IN as index into input line.
                     yoda doesn't have a variable >IN for this purpose, and
                     consequently can quit not set it to zero.
