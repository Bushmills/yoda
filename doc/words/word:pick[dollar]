contexts:            stateless
category:            strings

decription:          picks u-most string of string stack and pushes it to top.
                     counting is 0 based: a value of 0 for u duplicates top
                     string stack item, a value of 1 has same effect as over$,

standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
