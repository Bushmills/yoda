decription:          compiling words into new words will normally result in a
                     function call. Tagging a just compiled word with "inline"
                     instructs the compiler to insert the code the functions
                     contains instead.

example:             : reverse3  swap rot ;   inline
                     : test   reverse3 ;
                     see test

notes:               affects the most recently compiled word.
                     Should not have any effect on data words, as those are
                     inline compiled anyway.
