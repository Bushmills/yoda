category:            strings

decription:          return the u first chars of $1 and return them as $2.
                     if u is equal of bigger than the number of chars in $1,
                     the whole string $1 is returned as $2

notes:               none
                     left$ was once able to cut the specifed amount of characters
                     from the right when a negative number was given, but that
                     behaviour was lost in course of implementing better support
                     for signed vs unsigned numbers.

standard:            no
                     standard has no equivalent
