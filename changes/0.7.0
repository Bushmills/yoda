removed obsolete primitive "return".
Fixed an inconsistency with instant resolves: when a word is added by instant compile,
but to a wordlist which is not in search order, a "word not found" error will be
produced now, just as it would be if the word had been there all along. This also
fixes a glitch with instantly resolved shell command from library.
trying last assigned xt rather than headercount for determining whether headers
have stabilised when resolving forward references.
