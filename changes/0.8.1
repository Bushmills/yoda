trapping all cases where parsed name was expected but none found.
reviewed case insensitivity
undone factoring of four string types ("single" "multiple words"  'single'  'multi word')
   and split them into discrete words again. It was hard to reuse a single word dealing
   with all cases when " or ' were part of strings. Will try different factoring, for now
   the different types of strings are functional again with " and ' as part of the strings
   Change to before double quoted strings will expand during execution, single quoted
   strings won't, pretty much how you'd expect bash to deal with those.
.wordlists shows wids along with name of wordlists.
parse produces return value indicating where delimiter was found.
combined single and multi word patternlets, detecting mssing closing quotes.
