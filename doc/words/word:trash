category:
input stream:        space delimited string

decription:          read a space delimited string from input stream, discard the
                     header with that name. Function body remains untouched, as do
                     already compiled calls of that function. The only effect is that
                     the word can't be found by that name any longer, and the name is
                     free for reuse without yoda warning about redefinition.

standard:            no
