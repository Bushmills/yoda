decription:          jump to end of loop. Loop parameters will be cleaned up, and
                     execution continues after end of loop.

notes:               leave can be used in all these loop constructs:
                     do ... loop
                     ?do ... loop
                     do ... +loop
                     ?do ... +loop
                     for ... next

                     This is the unconditional version of ?leave

standard:            yes
