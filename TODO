--- problem solving todos
- exists shows irregular behaviour when querying an existing data item:
  no result is returned.
- +loop uses a rather simplistic end of loop checking, which
  doesn't work with negative loop increments

--- general todos
- allow customising query attributes
- allow customising prompt
- does>  tricky. consider detokeniser intervention
- add context vocabularies to selected searches (only undoc left)
- make header of currently compiled word non-findable until semicolon.
  can be done by classical hide/reveal,  by postponing header creation,
  or by moving when compilation has completed.
  postponing is probably the way to go: delegate to detokeniser.
- consider to let a satisfied u: turn forwardrefs on, and ; return to old state

--- optimiser todos:
- describe microinstructions effects to optimiser, using atom list
- have optimiser determine optimisable code sequences (linear code)
- run optimisable sequences with indicator data through arguments tracer.
- replace micro operations sequence to directly reflect tracer results.
- merge sequences of micro instructions to macro instructions.

--- common suspects
- documentation, tests
