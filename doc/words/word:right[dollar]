name:                right$
stack:               ( u -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( $1 -- $2 )
contexts:            stateless
category:            strings

decription:          return the last u chars of $1 and return them as $2.
                     if u equal the number of chars in $1, the whole string $1
                     is returned as $2. If u is higher than the number of chars
                     in $1, an empty string is returned

notes:               right$ was once able to cut the specifed amount of characters
                     from the left when a negative number was given, but that
                     behaviour was lost in course of implementing better support
                     for signed vs unsigned numbers. This also affected its behaviour
                     when u is higher than the number of chars.
                     It's possible that I'll eventually change right$ to restore the
                     former behaviour.
