--- todos solving problems, shortcomings, quirks
- ticking a word with headers in more than one context vocabulary allows
  no control nor test over which version was ticked.

--- general todos, improvements, fancyness
- if function associated with a trashed header is inlined, function body
  can be trashed as well.
- let yoda choose editor or xeditor according the environment it runs in.
- input line history would be nice
- string operations based on search and match are mostly absent.
  index / index$ might cover a lot already. cut$ was added

--- optimiser todos:
- describe microinstructions effects to optimiser, using atom list
- have optimiser determine optimisable code sequences (linear code)
- run optimisable sequences with indicator data through arguments tracer.
- replace micro operations sequence to directly reflect tracer results.
- merge sequences of micro instructions to macro instructions.

--- common suspects
- more tests
