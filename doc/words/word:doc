decription:          reads a word from input stream, which is appended to
                     a (currently hardcoded) dir $doc, then used as path/file
                     opened in an editor. Ideally "word" is the name of an existing
                     forsh word, and the opened file containing some informative descriptions.

example:             doc doc
