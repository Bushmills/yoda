decription:          shows a listing of all known named words in sections of all
                     populated vocabularies.

standard:            no.
deviation:           "List the definition names in the first word list of the search order"
                     yoda doesn't employ a traditional search order. Therefore can't words
                     be displayed sorted according that search order.
