string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            compileonly
category:            flow control

decription:          initiates a for ... next flow control construct, executing
                     a loop u times. A value of 0 for u will result in no
                     excecution of for ... next body.
                     Loop index can be produced by execution of i, starting with
                     u-1 and counting towards 0.

example:             none
notes:               In case of nest for ... next will the loop index of the
                     for ... next one level below be avalable by execution of j.
                     leave and ?leave can both be used within for ... next.
                     a for ... next generates simpler and therefore more
                     efficient code than a do ... loop

standard:            no
