name:                pick
stack:               ( ... u2 u1 u0 u -- u[u] )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            stack

decription:          use u as zero based index into stack and replace u
                     with the stack item indexed by it.

notes:               0 pick  is equivalent to a dup operation, 1 pick corresponds
                     with an over operation.

standard:            yes
