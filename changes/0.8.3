experimentally treating instantresolve like forwardrefs in definitions, if
   they are resolvable from library.
   consequence is that words which can be resolved from library need neither
   forwardrefs on, nor, alternatively, a prior "need word". Instead those
   words will silently be loaded and resolved.
dropped notion "instantrefs" completely, as well as all references to it.
It is now "levels of forward resolving", which are:
   0:  no forward referencing at all. Word not found -> throw error.
   1:  similar to former instantresolve:
      during interpretation: can word be resolved from library?
         yes: compile, execute.
         no: word not found
      during compilation: can word be resolved from library?
         yes: create forward ref, compile dangling call to word
         no:  throw error
   2: like former forwardrefs:
      during interpretation: same as like 1.
      during compilation:   always create forward ref, compule dangling call to word
"shortcuts"  -f +f  -i +i   are now:
      -f:   unchanged. set forward resolving to level 0 (similar to former -f -i)
      +f:   set forward resolving to level 1  (similar to former instantresolve on, +i)
      ++f   set forward resolving to level 2  (similar to former forwardredfs on, +f
