name:                to
stack:               ( x -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            memory
input stream:        word

description:         introduces x to the word whose name is read from stream such that
                     execution of that word will hence produce x.
                     Standard requires following word to be a value (that is, a word
                     created by defining word "value")

notes:               Contrary to standard is it possible to use to with any word, although
                     doing so is not encouraged. In that respect is "to" a rather dangerous
                     word in yoda, as it can change, for example, that nature and value of
                     system constants, or just any other word.
                     "to" shares this characteristic with "is"
standard:            yes
