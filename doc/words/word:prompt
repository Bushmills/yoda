decription:          outputs an " ok" prompt while interpreting, followed by a depiction
                     of stack item count. If any unresolved words are recorded, their
                     number is then shown.
                     When compiling does prompt only show a vertical bar.

example:             none
notes:               prompt is executed as part of the interactive interpreter loop "quit"
                     and is now a deferred word, to allow simple replacement against custom
                     prompts.
