For starting, you need at least these two files:
yoda
primitives.sh

While yoda will be able to run with just these two
files, you still may want to grab the rest, especially
yoda.conf, quit, and the subdirectories doc and lib.

Further instructions assume presence of files prelib
and postlib in the lib directory:

For an initial run, change to the directory which contains
the files yoda, primitives.sh and quit, and run there:
bash yoda quit

This requires that you have bash installed on your system.

Should you be greeted with a "Yoda shell" message, your
setup appears to be fine. Verify by tapping the "Enter"
key: an " ok" message should be produced.

Next steps could be to:
1. create symlinks to yoda and quit in a directory which
is in your PATH.  /usr/local/bin may be a good candidate.
Update the hashbang in quit which now specifies
/usr/local/bin/yoda as its interpreter, if necessary.

Now you should be able to launch quit or yoda from anywhere.
While yoda, the compiler, has no interactive command line or
shell itself, it is capable of compiling one when needed.
This is what you do by specifying "quit" as argument to
yoda, and also when running quit directly (using yoda as its
interpreter by virtue of its hashbang). Yoda will exit after
running, unless it was instructed in the file it loaded not
to do so (and instead run a word it had just compiled). quit
implements a simple interactive mode loop.

2. edit and customise, if appropriate, the file yoda.conf.
All settings should have been set to reasonable defaults,
but your preferences may differ.

3. Test editor and doc path settings by first launching quit,
then enter "topics". Of the list of numbered topics, choose one
which attracts your interest. Open it in the editor by typing the
number next to it, followed by space, the word "topic" and a tap
on the "Return" key. The picked topic should open, ready for reading.
If an empty file is opened, the topics doc directory isn't right (it
defaults to subdirectory doc/topics in the directory where yoda was
found and launched from). if no editor is launched, the editor
settings may need adjustment (editor defaults to vi, and can be changed
in yoda.conf)

4. editor can also be used to open included libraries. When loading
and running quit, just three of those should be present: prelib, postlib
and quit. Get a list of those by typing "files". Like "topics", these
are numbered. Use the number with "edit" to open, view and edit the chosen
library.

Similar first instructions can be obtained by executing "help" in the "quit"
shell.
