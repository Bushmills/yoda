name:                have
stack:               ( -- u )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )

category:            dictionary, conditional compilation

input stream:        word name

decription:          looks up word name in dictionary, returns 0 for word not found/
                     undefined, or the execution token associated with word.

contexts:            stateless

notes:               similar to ' , but doesn't throw an error if word not found.
                     This makes it useful for conditional compilation, where a
                     decision must be taken depending on whether a word exists.

                     Renamed former "exists" to have, as I wasn't really happy with former name.
