input stream:

decription:          searches for first occurance of $2 in $1, then remove matching
                     string and rest of string until end of string from $1. Return
                     the resulting string as $3. u is pushed to stack, informing how
                     many characters were removed from $1.


example:             "this foo could be rather nice if it was..."  "if" cut$
                        results in
                     "this foo could be rather nice "    ( on string stack )
                     12      ( count of removed chars, on stack )
