name:                literal
stack:               ( x -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            compileonly
category:            compiling

decription:          take a number from stack during compilation,
                     compile it into currently build definition such
                     that the number will be pushed to stack when
                     the definition executes.

example:             satisfy epoch
                     : foo  [ epoch ] literal ;
notes:               before using literal, take action that the value
                     it expects is actually on stack.
