description:         looks for the next undocumented word, generates a documentation
                     template, then launches editor on it. This is what I use for
                     documenting yet undocumented words.

notes:               both editor and doc directories must be properly setup in order
                     for undoc to function.

standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
