#!/usr/local/bin/yoda

\ loading this file creates a forward reference to quit,
\ which is resolved from library, then launched, providing
\ an interactive command line to yoda.

\ (Note that this forward reference is created even though
\ forward references are currently turned off.
\ The reason is that "boot" ignores forward reference
\ setting and creates an "explicit" forward reference anyway.
\ Another word to create explicit forward references is "need")

\ number output is so common that we want to have them along
\ with quit anyway, even though they're not depended upon:
need . need u.
from fix
boot quit                  ( "boot" sets the cold entry word )
"Yoda shell" type$ cr      ( rather chatty today, aren't we? )
