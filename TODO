--- todos solving problems, shortcomings, quirks
- ticking a word with headers in more than one context vocabulary allows
  no control nor test over which version was ticked.
- better support for unsigned
- does>  tricky. consider detokeniser intervention
- add context vocabularies to selected searches (only undoc remaining)

--- general todos, improvements, fancyness
- while "review" is functional, its implementation is a bit messy,
  specifically the way primitives store their location information.
- a "needed" for testing a list of words rather than just a single word
- string operations based on search and match are mostly absent.
  index / index$ might cover a lot already. cut$ was added
- addressing stack items per stack pointer, rather than by adding and
  removing top elements might save some instructions and potentially
  result in some speed increase, as may (test) more thorough use of
  arithmetic assignments, possibly avoiding some integer to string and
  back conversions
- string to number, number to string should respect base
- pictured number formatting
- allow customising query attributes
- allow customising prompt
- hide header of currently compiled word until compilation completed.
  can be done by classical hide/reveal,  by postponing header creation,
  or by moving when compilation has completed.
  postponing is probably the way to go: delegate to detokeniser.
- consider to let a satisfied u: turn forwardrefs on, and ; return to old state

--- optimiser todos:
- describe microinstructions effects to optimiser, using atom list
- have optimiser determine optimisable code sequences (linear code)
- run optimisable sequences with indicator data through arguments tracer.
- replace micro operations sequence to directly reflect tracer results.
- merge sequences of micro instructions to macro instructions.

--- common suspects
- documentation, tests
