name:                [char]
stack:               ( -- c )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            compileonly
category:            input, character conversion
input stream:        space delimited string (preferably single character, but not enforced)

decription:          read a space delimited string from input, and produce the
                     ASCII if its first character, pushed on stack as c.
                     Possibly more characters in that string will be ignored.

notes:               as an alternative to 'x  or  'x'  because getting escaping if single
                     quote right in bash source wasn't alwas trivial.
                     In yoda source,  single chars with leading single quotes, or enclosed
                     by single quotes should always be a viable alternative to [char]
