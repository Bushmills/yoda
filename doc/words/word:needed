category:            dictionary, loading file, conditional compilation
input stream:        whole input line

decription:          splits remainder of input line into space delimited strings,
                     which are tested as word names against being forward referenced.

                     words, the result flag is true.

notes:               Provides input for basing conditional compilation on

standard:            no
