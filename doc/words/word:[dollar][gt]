decription:          compares alphabetic order of two strings $1, $2. a true flag
                     is returned when position matching characters in $1 are
                     alphabetically sorted behind of corresponding characters in $2.
                     First character mismatch will determine sort order. If one
                     string is a substring of the other, the shorter string is considered
                     the "smaller" one.
