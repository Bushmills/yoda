stack:               ( -- )

contexts:            stateless
category:            compiling

description:         generates code pushing top of stack as literal to stack.

notes:               makes only sense to compile into a compile-only word which will,
                     when executed while contructing a word, compile code to the word
                     under construction. That code are the semantics of literal,.
                     After completion of construction will that word, when executed, push
                     to stack the number which was found on stack during compilation.
                     Mirrors compile,
                     Provided to implement literal
                     May be removed again anytime

example:             : foo  literal, ; compiled
                     : ten [ 10 ] foo ;
                     ten .  ( 10 )
standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
