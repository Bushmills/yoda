decoupled wordlist array names and vacabulary names. Consequently may vocabularies be anychar names,
rather than being restricted to array name friendly chars. wordlists array are named according the
pattern wordlist_$wid. header flags now per wordlist, rather than one single global array.
renamed detokeniser flag execute to call. codebody expects xt as arg now. added protected header flag,
protect flag modifier. use on words which may be referenced by xt only and candidates for getting
trashed. A scenario could be a word which was ticked for its xt, which was then bound to a defered
word. should the ticked word be set as inline AND not protected, trashing it (or setting it as transient)
will also remove its function - the code, that is -, leaving a dangling call in the deferred word.
So when using "inline" on a word of which you want to be sure that code stays even when trashed, also
mark it with "protect". I may eventually rename "protect" to "keep".
