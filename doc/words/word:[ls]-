name:                <-
stack:               ( a x -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            memory

decription:          store x in memory address a.
                     similar to ! but expecting reverse order of stack items.

standard:            no
                     standard has no equivalent, and
                     would code corresponding semantics as "swap !"
