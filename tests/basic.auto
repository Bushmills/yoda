testing basic assumptions
t{ -> }t               \ start with clean slate
( test if any bits are set; answer in base 1 )
t{ : bitsset? if 0 0 else 0 then ; -> }t
t{  0 bitsset? -> 0 }t      ( zero is all bits clear )
t{  1 bitsset? -> 0 0 }t      ( other number have at least one bit )
t{ -1 bitsset? -> 0 0 }t
