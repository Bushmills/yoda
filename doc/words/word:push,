description:         during compilation a string $1 is taken from string stack. That string
                     must, when evaluated by bash, produce a number. Code is compiled to
                     push a number with string as expression, to be evaluated at
                     run time.

example:             : foo [ "RANDOM" ] push, ;
                     compiles to foo the code:
                     ((s[++sp]=RANDOM))

standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
