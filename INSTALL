For starting, you need at least the file  yoda

While yoda will be able to run all alone, you still
may want to grab the rest, especially yoda.conf, and
the subdirectories doc and lib.

Further instructions assume presence of populated lib
directory:

For an initial test run, change to the directory which
contains the file yoda and the subdirecty "lib" with at
least the file "fix" in it, and run there:

   bash yoda

Should you be greeted with a "Yoda shell" message, your
setup appears to be fine. Verify by tapping the "Enter"
key: an " ok" message should be produced.

Now proceed with finalising the installation:
1. create a symlink to yoda in a directory which
   is in your PATH.  /usr/local/bin may be a good candidate.

As result of the above step should you now be able to launch
yoda from anywhere.

2. edit and customise, if appropriate, the file yoda.conf,
which can be found in the same directory where yoda resides.
All settings should have been set to reasonable defaults,
but your preferences may differ.

3. Test editor and doc path settings by launching yoda, then 
try to open the definition of a word by entering review followed
by the name of the word. For example

   review .

should open the definition of .  in the editor. Similarily, the
definition of "review" itself can be opened too:

   review review

4. create the file which tells yoda what files to include when
forward referenced word are needed:

   dependencies

or, from bash command line when yoda wasn't started:

   yoda dependencies
