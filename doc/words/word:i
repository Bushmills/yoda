name:                i
stack:               ( -- x )

string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            flow control

decription:          return the loop index of the innermost loop. If there's no such loop,
                     the returned value is meaningless.
                     i works with do ... loop type loops, with for ... next loops, and
                     also with interpreted "times" style loops.
