description:         the value returned by dpl reflects the position of the decimal
                     point as found during last conversion of a double length number.
                     The value is identical to the number of digits right of the
                     decimal point, that is, the length of the fraction, regardless
                     of sign or radix of the numeric value the string was converted
                     to. Think of dpl as scaling factor of 1/base^dpl.

example:             1.230 d. dpl .  ( 1230 3 )
standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
