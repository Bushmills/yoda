name:                d=
stack:               ( x1 x2 x3 x4 -- f )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            compare, arithmetic

decription:          while taken from the doubles word set, it has its use with pairs of
                     stack items too, which is why it has been added: returns true when
                     (x1 == x3) AND (x2 == x4), false otherwise.
