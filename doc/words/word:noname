description:         renders the last word headerless and produces its execution
                     token xt. For defing the word, prior to use of "noname",
                     a name is still needed. That name can of course be a throwaway
                     dummy name.
                     As noname operates on words in general, not just on colon
                     words, any newly defined dictionary word can be rendered
                     headerless.

example:             : foo ... ;  noname execute
notes:               You may want to keep execution token, or access to the word
                     will be lost.

standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no exact equivalent,
                     :noname is a coarse approximation.
