context:             interpreting, compiling
category:            arithmetics, system


context:             interpreting
decription:          returns as n2 the count of cells needed to store n1 integers


context:             compiling
decription:          effectively a no ooperation, not compiling any code,
                     therefore leaving n1 on stack unmodified

standard:            yes
