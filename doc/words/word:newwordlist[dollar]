category:            wordlists

decription:          creates a new wordlist, identified by wid. A name will be associated
                     with wid, which is specified as $1

notes:               the associated name is not a header created, merely a string
                     in string memory. As wordlists are represented by bash hashed arrays,
                     this name will be used as array name. It can also easily be produced
                     from wid.
                     Because name is used to name the bash array, it must therefore be
                     a name suitable as bash array name, disallowing some characters.
                     Safe characters are alphanumerical characters and _
                     To output the name of a given wid:   ( wid -- )   $@ type$

standard:            no
