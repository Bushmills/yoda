name:                times
stack:               ( u -- )
return stack:        ( -- u2 )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            interpretonly
category:            flow control
input stream:        whole input line

decription:          repeat execution of remainder of input line u times.
                     The count of remaining executions of input line can
                     be produced by execution of i.  In case of nested
                     execution of times can the count of remaining
                     executions of the next level of times be produced by
                     executing j. The temporarily stacked u2 on return
                     stack will be removed again after last execution of
                     times.

example:             3 times  cr  4 times   j . i .  space
