decription:          returns a file load counter u. first time a file is loaded the
                     counter contains 0, which gets increment each time the file is
                     loaded, therefore can this value be used as flag for initial loading
                     vs reload detection.
                     To protect against reloading, the file may contain a line like
                        loaded lest done
                     for an action to take place only first time a file is loaded, but
                     proceed with loading in any case, use
                        loaded unless  "first time loading" type$ cr

contexts:            interpreting, loading

notes:               using "loaded" only makes sense with words which execute while
                     loading from file.
