description:         start an "if ... then"  or  "if ... else ... then"
                     conditional sequence. Code code following if will be
                     executed when flag is true, skipped until "else" or "then"
                     otherwise.

notes:               stack diagram as depicted describes run time stack effect.
                     The compile time stack effect differs: During compilation are
                     items stacked, which allow checking that if will be properly
                     paired with else or then. As those don't have any effect on
                     run time semantics of if, they're not described here.
