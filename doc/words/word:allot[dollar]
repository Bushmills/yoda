category:            strings

decription:          adds u to sdp, the offset to first free string memory location,
                     akin to how allot increments dp.

notes:               string memory is organised such that each location can hold a
                     string - it's not meant to bump here$ by the number of characters
                     in the string. Neither is it to unpack the string into individual
                     bytes. Strings can be left while, and stored on each in every
                     location by single increments of here$
