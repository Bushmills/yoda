name:                mod
stack:               ( n1 n2 -- n3 )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            arithmetics

decription:          calculates remainder resulting from dividing signed
                     integers n1/n2 and returns it as n3

notes:               for the reason why sign is applied the way it is, please
                     check out /mod, and consider that adding remainder to
                     product of quotient and divisor must yield the original divident.

standard:            yes
