name:                bounds
stack:               ( start n -- limit start )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            arithmetics, flow control helper

decription:          converts start, count parameters to do ... loop compatible
                     limit, start parameters.

example:             10 5 bounds
                     \ produces loop parameters for do which run 5 iterations
                     \ with a loop index starting at 10

notes:               interestingly will repetitive execution of bounds on its
                     own results, when starting with 0 1, produce the fibonacci
                     sequence.

standard:            no
                     standard has no equivalent
                     (but can be easily built from standard words)
