description:         creates a new wordlist, identified by wid. A name will be associated
                     with wid, which is specified as $1

notes:               the associated name is not a header created, merely a string
                     in string memory. As wordlists are represented by bash hashed arrays,
                     this name will be used as array name. It can also easily be produced
                     from wid.
standard:            no
