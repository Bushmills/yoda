string stack:        ( -- )

decription:          a variable, serving as flag to turn resolving of interpretative
                     forward references on. When enabled will unknown words, entered
                     at interpretation time, be resolved immediately from portlib. If
                     a word was resolved successfully, it will be executed directly
                     after, otherwise an error is reported.

contexts:            stateless

example:             forwardrefs on
                     instantresolve on

notes:               don't enable instantresolve and shell at the same time:
                     not finding a shell command and including a not found 
                     yoda word don't harmonise well.
