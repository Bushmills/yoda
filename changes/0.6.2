source locations are correct again: defining words inject a pseudo op with file handle, line number as
parameters. postprocessing will use those after header creation to set proper source data.
last is still updated during header creation, and contents will be wrong when read during compilation
of a word, as it will still refer to previous word. probably. Wrong, anyway. Would need defining words
to update last, rather than the postponed header word. Come to think of it, keeping update of last in
postponed header, and then in additionally just in colon should do. Alternatively, move it from postponed
header to code injecting the header creating pseudo op.
Done so now: last is updated in delayheader, the word which inject header creation pseudo op. header,
which do so before, isn't involved in updating last any longer.
returned[] removed again, in favour of functions returning results in variables of same name as functions.
filehandle,line number in where pseudo op arg now seperated by : rather than by space.
