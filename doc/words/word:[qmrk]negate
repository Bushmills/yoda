name:                ?negate
stack:               ( n1 flag -- n2 )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            arithmetic

decription:          conditionally negates a number. A non-zero flag causes sign change
                     to n1 which is returned as n2

standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
