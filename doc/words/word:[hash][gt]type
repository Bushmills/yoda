name:                #>type
stack:               ( x -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( $1 -- )
category:            number conversion, I/O

decription:          completes a pictured number conversion sequence, by
                     finalising the buffered converted number, outputting
                     it, and cleaning up stacks.
                     meant to be used in conjunction with <#

contexts:            stateless
example:             <# # # #>type
notes:               functional equivalent to "#> type", but more efficient.
