name:                realtime
stack:               ( -- u )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
category:            time

decription:          return the number of microseconds elapsed since 1970jan1.
                     Similar to epoch, but with higher resolution.

contexts:            stateless

notes:               chosen arithmetic model (bit per cell) must be large enough
                     for an integer to hold a number of this size (51 bits), or it
                     will get truncated. It will still be possible to use that
                     number for some tasks, for example measurement of elapsed time,
                     but be aware that the fewer bits are available, the more frequently
                     an overflow and consequently numeric wraparound takes place - more
                     than 15 times per second when a 16 bit model was chosen.
