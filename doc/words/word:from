name:                from
stack:               ( -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            file loading
input stream:        space delimited string

decription:          read a string from input stream which is used as file name for
                     reading a file and evaluating its contents.
                     File names without path are considered libraries, and all directories
                     of ${libdirs[@]} - which is a configuration item - are searched for
                     file. file names with path specification - where path can also refer
                     to current directory by preceding it with "./" - are only looked for
                     in the specified directory.
                     Path and names of loaded files are added to an array which can be
                     displayed by executing "files"

notes:               a variant of from expecting file name on string stack exists as from$
                     from (or from$) can be nested.
