decription:          switches compiler state to compiling

notes:               not very useful without prior [ inside of a definition:
                     "switching compiler state to compiling" doesn't actually
                     mean "compile input to code". Instead, encountered statement
                     will be buffered, and only when ; executes will it be
                     "compiled" into a function, while ; without prior :  will
                     complain about inproper structure.

standard:            Not sure, due to possibly different interpretation of
                     "switching compiler state to compiling" and to ]
                     being useless when used outside of a colon definition.
