decription:          jump to end of loop. Loop parameters will be cleaned up, and
                     execution continues after end of loop.

notes:               leave can be used within all these loop constructs:
                     do ... loop
                     ?do ... loop
                     do ... +loop
                     ?do ... +loop
                     for ... next
                     times

                     This is the unconditional version of ?leave
