decription:          a variable, serving as flag to turn resolving of interpretative
                     forward references on. When enabled will unknown words, entered
                     at interpretation time, be resolved immediately from portlib. If
                     a word was resolved successfully, it will be executed directly
                     after, otherwise an error is reported.

contexts:            interpreting, compiling

example:             forwardrefs on
                     instantresolve on

notes:               needs forwardrefs to be turned on.
                     Feature is still experimental, handle carefully.
