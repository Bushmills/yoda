description:         creates a forward reference by the name of space delimited string,
                     parsed from input stream. As consequence can that word be compiled
                     into other words. Resolving takes place automatically at appropriate
                     times, or can be forced by executing "resolve", assuming the word can
                     be resolved from library.
                     As long as the word hasn't been resolved, it can't be executed.
                     Defining the word (interactively or by loading from a file) are
                     other methods to resolve the word.

notes:               contrary to "satisfy" does need not throw an error if a
                     word can't be resolved immediately.
