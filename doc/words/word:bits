description:         returns the number of bits an integer is wide. This is a
                     configuration item which can be set in yoda.conf

example:             none
notes:               maximum value should not exceed 63. This constant exists so that
                     yoda can provide words for both signed and unsigned operations

standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
