description:         return the loop index of loop enclosing the innermost loop.
                     If there's no such loop, the returned value is meaningless.
                     j works with do ... loop type loops, and also with for ... next
                     loops, including different type of loops for innermost and surrounding
                     loops.
                     j also works with nested interpreted "times" style loops.
