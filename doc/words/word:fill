name:                fill
stack:               ( a u c -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
decription:          fill u memory locations fromon a with c

notes:               while c is meant to describe a character, fill will happily accept
                     non byte sized parameter for c, and fill memory with it.
                     That's possible because memory cells aren't byte sized with yoda.

standard:            yes
