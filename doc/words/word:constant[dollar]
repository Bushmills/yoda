description:         A defining word for creating constants. Name of a created constant
                     is taken from string stack, with value x associated with it.

example:             10 "ten" constant$
notes:               don't confuse with $constant which creates a constant associated with
                     a string from string stack (as value, not as name, that is)

standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
