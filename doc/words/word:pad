decription:          pushes the address of a memory region which can be used as
                     transient memory buffer. Contents should be treated as temporary
                     working space, not for storage, as they may get modified.

contexts:            stateless
notes:               returned address is relative to the address generated by
                     execution of "here", therefore will any action which changes
                     the address of "here" also change the address of "pad".
