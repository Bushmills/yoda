name:                ?leave
stack:               ( f -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            compileonly
category:            flow control

decription:          jump to end of loop conditinally. If flag f is not false, loop parameters
                     will be cleaned up, and execution continues after end of
                     loop. If flag f is false, execution continues with the word following
                     ?leave.

notes:               ?leave can be used in all these loop constructs:
                     do ... loop
                     ?do ... loop
                     do ... +loop
                     ?do ... +loop
                     for ... next

                     see leave for an unconditioan version of ?leave

standard:            yes
