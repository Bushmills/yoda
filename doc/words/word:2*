name:                2*
stack:               ( x1 -- x2 )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
category:            arithmetics

decription:          multiply x1 with 2

contexts:            stateless
notes:               was meant to be unnecessary because optimiser is supposed
                     to generate identical code from 2 * but as that's not
                     already happening, 2* was added for convenience
