name:                state
stack:               ( -- a )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            compiling

description:         state produces an address containing a flag, reflecting
                     current compilation state. false indicates "interpreting",
                     true means "compiling".

notes:               you may want to use non-standard "compiling" which
                     pushes the same flag directly to stack, no need to fetch.
                     state is read-only. writing to it has no effect, and at
                     next execution of state will the contents be updated again.
standard:            yes
