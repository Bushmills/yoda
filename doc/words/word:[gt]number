description:         read not more than u1 characters from c-addr1 which are, if those
                     represent legal digits in the current number base, accumulated into
                     ud2. Conversion stops when a character is encountered which doesn't
                     represent a legal digit, in which case will c-addr2 point to the
                     first non-digit character, and u2 indicates the count of yet
                     unconverted characters.
