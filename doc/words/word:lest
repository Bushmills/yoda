name:                lest
stack:               ( f -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            compilation
category:            flow control

decription:          compiles a conditional branch which causes the word, when
                     executed, to skip all remaining code until end of function
                     if flag f is false. Or, said differently, will allow
                     execution of rest of function only when flag f is true.

example:             : foo   condition lest "is true" type$  ;
notes:               complementary to "unless"
