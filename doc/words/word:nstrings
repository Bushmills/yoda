decription:          a variable whose contents are incremented for each created
                     $constant or $variable. Its value is used as index into a
                     string array where $constant or $variables store or keep
                     their contents.

notes:               probably not very useful for programs, but needed to expose
                     this variable, as definitions of $constant and $variables
                     have to be able to access it.
