Occasionally does yoda use an external program for its operations.
Those are, apart from bash:
        sed         # used by dodoes, topics
        sort        # used by crossref

further programs, optional:
a supported editor. "Support" means, an editor which can, after opening
the file, move the cursor to a position as specified on command line.
Ideally to column and row, but just to row is ok too.
For two handfuls of editors, supporting code has been added and can
be found in the file libs/fix. Using those definitions it shouldn't be
too hard to add support for other editors not listed there.
