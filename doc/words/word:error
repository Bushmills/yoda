decription:          returns the most recent "internal" error, of limited use to
                     general code, and only exposed to allow the a custom definition
                     of prompt to terminate early in case of error.

example:             none
notes:               reason for why that variable exists at all is the lack of a
                     "real" warm start possibility which also clears the internal
                     call stack. It is therefore attempted to pass error conditions
                     through to code like prompt so the currently running quit loop
                     can be reused rather than another copy launched on top of current
                     call stack.

standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
