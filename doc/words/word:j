name:                j
stack:               ( -- x )
return stack:        ( x -- x )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            flow control

decription:          return the loop index of loop enclosing the innermost loop.
                     If there's no such loop, the returned value is meaningless.
                     j works with do ... loop type loops, and also with for ... next
                     loops, including different type of loops for innermost and surrounding
                     loops.
                     j also works with nested interpreted "times" style loops.

standard:            no
deviation:           Execution: ( -- n | u ) ( R: loop-sys1 loop-sys2 -- loop-sys1 loop-sys2 )
                     "n | u is a copy of the next-outer loop index."
                     As yoda caches loop-sys2 in a variable, rather than pushing it to
                     return stack, loop-sys2 is not present on R, but loop-sys1 takes
                     its place.
