name:                hold
stack:               ( c -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( $1 -- $2 )
category:            number conversion

decription:          meant for use during pictured number conversion, the character c
                     is prepended to the string on string stack, allowing to insert
                     characters of choice into the number in process of being converted.

contexts:            interpreting, compiling

example:             none

notes:               While yoda allows using hold in different contexts than pictured
                     number conversion, I advise to refrain from doing so, as such
                     programs will most definitely become incompatible with any other
                     Forth- or forthlike compiler.
                     "char$ swap$ join$" will achieve the same (while not making your
                     program any more compatible with other systems :) )
