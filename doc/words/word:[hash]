decription:          meant to be used between <# and #>, its operation is part of
                     converting an integer to a string. # will convert a single digit
                     of u1, respecting base, to a character which then will be prepended to
                     the string on string stack. Repeatedly executing # will build the
                     string representation of the integer digit by digit, while gradually
                     diminishing u1 until 0 is left, and nothing more needs converting.
