description:         meant to be used between <# and #>, its operation is part of
                     converting a double integer to a string. # will convert a single
                     digit of ud1, respecting base, to a character which then will be
                     prepended to the string on string stack. Repeatedly executing #
                     will build the string representation of the integer digit by digit,
                     while gradually diminishing ud1 until 0 is left, and nothing more
                     needs converting.
