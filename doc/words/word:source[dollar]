name:                source$
stack:               ( -- )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- $1 )
contexts:            stateless
category:            I/O, interpreting
input stream:        whole line

decription:          places a copy of remainder of input line on string stack,
                     without affeceting input stream.
                     This means, interpreting will continue unchanged, but
                     there'll be a copy of not yet executed input on string stack,
                     which can be used to look ahead and respond in advance.

example:             : limit  ( u -- ) source$ count$ > unless done ;
                     10 limit ...      \ ignore rest of line if longer than 10 chars.

standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
