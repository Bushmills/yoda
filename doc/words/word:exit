contexts:            compiling
category:            flow control

decription:          break out of a function early, preventing execution of
                     code following exit.

notes:               makes often more sense in combination with some conditionals
                     guarding it. For a presentable alternative, hiding the flair
                     of unstructuredness of exit, see lest and unless.

standard:            no
deviation:           Execution:  ( -- ) ( R: nest-sys -- )
                     "Return control to the calling definition specified by nest-sys."
                     yoda doesn't use R for carrying nest-sys. Therefore can EXIT not
                     return to nest-sys on R.
