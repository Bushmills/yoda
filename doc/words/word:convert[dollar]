contexts:            stateless
category:            number conversion, strings

decription:          converts a string to a number

example:             "22" "05" join$ convert$ .
                     ( gives 2205 )
notes:               word has been moved to library
                     this function doesn't at this point respect value of number base,
                     but uses radix 10 for conversion. The string must therefore consist
                     of character 0...9 only, leading dash is permitted.
                     The string may also be a bash-computable expression.
