description:         a wordlist which is searched first during compilation. Any
                     word found in there will be executed, akin to what would be
                     expected from immediate words.
                     postpone will search through compiler before consulting the
                     wordlist in search order.

notes:               made visible to allow controlling searching by adding compiler
                     to order.
standard:            no
