( ud1 c-addr1 u1 -- ud2 c-addr2 u2 )
ud2 is the unsigned result of converting the characters within the string
specified by c-addr1 u1 into digits, using the number in BASE, and adding
each into ud1 after multiplying ud1 by the number in BASE. Conversion
continues left-to-right until a character that is not convertible, including
any "+" or "-", is encountered or the string is entirely converted. c-addr2
is the location of the first unconverted character or the first character
past the end of the string if the string was entirely converted. u2 is the
number of unconverted characters in the string. An ambiguous condition
exists if ud2 overflows during the conversion.
