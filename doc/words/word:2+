name:                2+
stack:               ( x1 -- x2 )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )

category:            arithmetics

decription:          add two to x1.

contexts:            stateless
notes:               was meant to be unnecessary because optimiser is supposed
                     to generate identical code from 2 + but as that's not
                     already happening, 2+ was added for convenience
