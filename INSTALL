For starting, you need at least the file  yoda

While yoda will be able to run all alone, you still
may want to grab the rest, especially yoda.conf, and
the subdirectories doc and lib.

Further instructions assume presence of file postlib
in the lib directory:

For an initial test run, change to the directory which
contains the file yoda and the subdirecty "lib" with at
least files postlib, quit and fix in it, and run there:

   bash yoda words

If a list of words is shown, then control returned to shell,
inclusion of primitives.sh was successful, which means that
loading a library file might do too. This tests whether yoda
was able to search its library directories for files:

   bash yoda

Should you be greeted with a "Yoda shell" message, your
setup appears to be fine. Verify by tapping the "Enter"
key: an " ok" message should be produced.

Now proceed with finalising the installation:
1. create a symlink to yoda in a directory which
   is in your PATH.  /usr/local/bin may be a good candidate.

As result of the above step should you now be able to launch
yoda from anywhere.
While yoda, the compiler, has no interactive command line or
shell itself, it is capable of compiling one when needed.
This is what you do by calling yoda without arguments, or
alternatively by "quit" directly (or from symlink)-

2. edit and customise, if appropriate, the file yoda.conf.
All settings should have been set to reasonable defaults,
but your preferences may differ.

3. Test editor and doc path settings by first launching quit,
then enter "topics". Of the list of numbered topics, choose one
which attracts your interest. Open it in the editor by typing the
number next to it, followed by space, the word "topic" and a tap
on the "Return" key. The picked topic should open, ready for reading.
If an empty file is opened, the topics doc directory isn't right (it
defaults to subdirectory doc/topics in the directory where yoda was
found and launched from). if no editor is launched, the editor
settings may need adjustment (editor defaults to vi, and can be changed
in yoda.conf)

4. editor can also be used to open included libraries.
Currently 5 libraries will show when executing "files":
primitives.sh, prelib, quit, fix and postlib.
Like "topics", these are numbered. Use the number with "edit"
to open, view and edit the chosen library.

Similar first instructions can be obtained by executing "help" in
the "quit" shell.
