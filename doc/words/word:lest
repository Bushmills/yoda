context:             interpreting
description:         execute remainder of line only if flag f is true.
                     A false flag results in ignoring rest of line, as if
                     it was a comment.
example:             false lest  this will be ignored


context:             compiling
decription:          compiles a conditional branch which causes the word, when
                     executed, to skip all remaining code until end of function
                     if flag f is false. Or, said differently, will allow
                     execution of rest of function only when flag f is true.

example:             : foo   condition lest "is true" type$  ;

standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
