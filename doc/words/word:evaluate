name:                evaluate
stack:               ( ??? -- ??? )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( ??? -- ??? )

category:            compiler, interpreter

decription:          execute the source line in environment variable "tib"

contexts:            interpreting, compiling
example:             none
notes:               rather than creating a series of commands as string on string stack,
                     then writing it into environement variable tib for evaluation by
                     "evaluate", consider to evaluate top of string stack directly, using
                     evaluate$
