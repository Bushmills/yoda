description:         prepend a hyphen ("-") to top of string stack item if n is negative

notes:               meant to be used within a pictured number conversion sequence,
                     "sign" doesn't require being used within <#  #>, though its
                     use without seems limited.
                     "sign" doesn "apply" sign, not does it change sign - it merely
                     prepends (or doesn't) a hyphen.

standard:            I think so
