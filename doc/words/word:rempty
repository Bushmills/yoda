stack:               ( -- )
return stack:        ( ??? -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
contexts:            stateless
category:            return stack

decription:          empties and reinitialises return stack

example:             none
notes:               a convenience word, supplied only because return stack in
                     yoda is not used according to what its name suggest: It
                     won't carry return addresses. As such is it possibly to
                     push and keep items on it unintentionally, without yoda
                     balking at unexecutable code. Therefore has rempty been
                     provided to reset it easily when needed.
