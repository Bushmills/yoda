yoda relies on these external program for execution of few words:

      sed         # used by dodoes, topics
                  # changing topics to not depend on sed should be easy, but
                  # seems needless as long as the dodoes dependency still exists.

      sort        # used by crossref.
                  # As I may remove crossref, this dependency may get dropped

No test for their presence is performed, as both are considered pretty standard
on any system able to run bash.

Optionally, a supported editor is used by:

      topic
      edit
      doc
      undoc
(these are all related to viewing and editing documentation files)

      fix
      reveal
(in library file "fix")

"Support" means, an editor which can, after opening
the file, move the cursor to a position as specified on command line.
Ideally to column and row, but just to row is ok too.
For two handfuls of editors, supporting code has been added, and can be
found in the file libs/fix. Using those definitions it shouldn't be
too hard to add support for other editors not listed there.
The editors for which support has been preconfigured are:

      nano
      mcedit
      jupp
      joe
      vi
      emacs
      featherpad
      mousepad
      efte
      gedit

Any of those can be specified in yoda.conf configuration file.
