category:            dictionary, compilation

decription:          moves the header of the most recently defined word into
                     the compile-only context vocabulary. The result is that
                     the word can only be found during compilation, but not
                     while interpreting.

notes:               This replaces the common scheme of marking words as
                     "immediate", and as such making them state smart.

examples:            word "unless" has been defined with compile time semantics
                     of conditionally exiting the word (conceptualised as "jumping
                     to its end") while deviating interpret time semantics skip
                     evaluation of rest of the input line, conditionally.
