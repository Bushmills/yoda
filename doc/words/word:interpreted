category:            dictionary, compilation

decription:          moves the header of the most recently defined word into
                     the interpret-only context vocabulary. The result is that
                     the word can only be found during interpretation, but not
                     during compilation.

notes:               Useful specifically for an interpretative version of words
                     with the same name as those which have been moved to the
                     compile-only vocabulary, for achieving different run- and
                     compile time semantics for words with identical names.

examples:            word "unless" has been defined with compile time semantics
                     of conditionally exiting the word (conceptualised as "jumping
                     to its end") while deviating interpret time semantics skip
                     evaluation of rest of the input line, conditionally.

standard:            no
                     standard has no equivalent
