For starting, you need at least these two files:
yoda
primitives.sh

While yoda will be able to run with just these two
files, you still may want to grab the rest, especially
yoda.conf, and the subdirectories doc and lib.

Further instructions assume presence of files prelib
and postlib in the lib directory:

For an initial run, change to the directory which contains
the files yoda, primitives.sh and quit, and run there:
bash yoda from quit

This requires that you have bash installed on your system.

Should you be greeted with a "Yoda shell" message, your
setup appears to be fine. Verify by tapping the "Enter"
key: an " ok" message should be produced.

Next steps could be to:
1. create symlink to yoda in a directory which
   is in your PATH.  /usr/local/bin may be a good candidate.

   create a symlink to quit in the lib directory, also
   in your PATH, to launch directly into the interpreter.

Now you should be able to launch quit or yoda from anywhere.
While yoda, the compiler, has no interactive command line or
shell itself, it is capable of compiling one when needed.
This is what you do by specifying "from quit" as argument to
yoda.
Yoda will exit after running, unless it was instructed in the
file it loaded not to do so (and instead run a word it had just
compiled).
quit implements a simple interactive mode loop.

2. edit and customise, if appropriate, the file yoda.conf.
All settings should have been set to reasonable defaults,
but your preferences may differ.

3. Test editor and doc path settings by first launching quit,
then enter "topics". Of the list of numbered topics, choose one
which attracts your interest. Open it in the editor by typing the
number next to it, followed by space, the word "topic" and a tap
on the "Return" key. The picked topic should open, ready for reading.
If an empty file is opened, the topics doc directory isn't right (it
defaults to subdirectory doc/topics in the directory where yoda was
found and launched from). if no editor is launched, the editor
settings may need adjustment (editor defaults to vi, and can be changed
in yoda.conf)

4. editor can also be used to open included libraries. 
Currently 5 libraries will show when runing "files":
primitives.sh, prelib, quit, fix and postlib.
Like "topics", these are numbered. Use the number with "edit"
to open, view and edit the chosen library.

Similar first instructions can be obtained by executing "help" in the "quit"
shell.
