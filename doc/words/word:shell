name:                shell
stack:               ( -- a )
return stack:        ( -- )
string stack:        ( -- )
decription:          a variable, used as flag to turn off or on passing unknown
                     words for execution to shell.

contexts:            interpreting, compiling

example:             shell on

notes:               a combination of forwardrefs, instanresolve and shell all turned
                     on can't be recommended, as word searching path can get rather
                     complicated and harder to predict.
