description:         use top string stack item as file name, or path & file name,
                     and load source from that file. If path is specified, only
                     that location is attempted to open file. Files names without
                     a path (i.e. containing no "/" characters) are searched through
                     the directories listed in array variable libdirs (configuration
                     item)

example:             none
notes:               this complements "from" which takes file name from
                     input stream instead.
                     "from$" are nestable

standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
