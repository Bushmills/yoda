description:         during compilation a string $1 is taken from string stack. That string
                     must, when evaluated, produce a legal expression bash can assign a value
                     to. Code is compiled to pop a number from stack and assing it to the
                     result of that expression when executed at run time.

example:             : stopwatch ( xt -- )  0 [ "SECONDS" dup$ ] pop$ execute push$ ;
                           results in code:
                     ((s[++sp]=0));
                     ((SECONDS=s[sp--]));          \ SECONDS=0
                     yoda_${s[sp--]};              \ execute
                     ((s[++sp]=SECONDS))           \ push SECONDS

notes:               akin to  >env, but generating better code.
standard:            no
deviation:           standard has no equivalent
